This is the initial version of wbgen2. Requires Lua 5.1!. Enjoy it :)
Does not work with 5.2 or 5.3.

Compilation instructions:
Just type "make" in the main directory of wbgen2. The resulting file will be "wbgen2".

//MG
As far as I can see Makefile is called by squish
squishy is a configuration file for squish.
New sources must be added to squishy.
Compilation is done with ./squish
//MG

There is still some stuff to do:
- add FIFO register  support
- CONSTANT registers
- Verilog primitive library
